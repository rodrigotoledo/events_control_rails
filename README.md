## Development

### Using TDD

Always code with TDD, so you can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
bundle exec guard
```

## Commit and contribute

To features use the prefix `feature`. For example

```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/crud_user
```

For fixes, use the prefix `fix`. For example

```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b fix/fix_in_crud_user
```

And to commit, its good practice use the `aicommit` package with the following command:

```bash
aicommits --generate 5
```

And choice the best option to commit.

Finally, you can merge the branch with `develop` and `main` branches.
